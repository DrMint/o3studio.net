short: "Three months after the death of the 17th Angel, NERV and its people struggle to survive. The Children face new challenges and the lingering traumas of the past, but for two of them the most difficult test may just be each other. Amidst such personal conflicts, individuals and organizations accelerate their agendas in their bid for power and control of the most powerful weapon on Earth: the Evangelion."

With Neon Genesis Evangelion: Genocide, Rommel manages to build upon the 1995 series and subsequent movies, delivering a faithful alternative storyline that perfectly captures the spirit and feeling of the original show.

Following the events of episode 24, Genocide’s plot unfolds in a series of heartbreaks and touching moments, punctuated by daunting action scenes.

New and unforeseen events allow for the reader to witness how our beloved cast of characters—and new ones—reacts and develops.

Will the damaged children be able to overcome their trauma, accept reality, and maybe even themselves?
